Task 0: Create a new repository
================================

Similar to last time we want to create a new repository that we use for this
workshop. Please note that we want to create a repository in the group
`kiwi-git-workshops <https://git.tu-berlin.de/kiwi-git-workshops>`_.

For step by step instructions on how to create a repository, you can take
a look at the creating a :ref:`new-repository` page.

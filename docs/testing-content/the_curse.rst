The Curse of Unit Tests
=======================

Reasons against Testing
_______________________

There is a couple of "reasons" out there why people do not want to test their
code

* my project is late
* do not touch my code it works
* my code is un-testable
* I just work on the project myself

No doubt testing your code is hard now, but working on non-tested code is
much harder in the long term. Its kind of an investment that will pay off in
the future.

Benefits of Testing
___________________

How tested code makes your life easier:

* more certainty on how it works
* increases trustworthiness
* reduces technical depth
* documents the usage of your code
* puts yourself into your users' shoes
* fosters good coding practices
* focus on your current task and forget about the rest of the code
* Be lazy! Let the computer do the checking.

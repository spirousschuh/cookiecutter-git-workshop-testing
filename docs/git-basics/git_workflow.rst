Git Workflow
============


Idea
====

This is a concise manual to a basic Git workflow. You can find more details
`here <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_. For each step you can
find instructions how to follow that workflow using PyCharm. There is different
ways to achieve the same goal without PyCharm. Once you are familiar with the
basic concepts you can use any tool you like.


Instructions
============

Once you have an idea what you want to achieve the following steps will help you
to get there.

.. contents:: Steps
    :local:




Update Local
____________

First we want to make sure to use the newest version of the repositories main
branch. Therefore we click on the button in the bottom right corner next to the
patlock. Then we see a context menue like this that displays all the local 
branches.

.. image:: ../images/checkout_branch.png

Click on the main/master branch and choose "Checkout" in the second context 
menue to switch to the main/master branch.
Now we need to make sure that your local main/master branch is up to date with
the upstream main/master. Therefore we pull the newest state from upstream. In 
the upper left corner we can find the menue bar, click on "Git" and choose pull
in the pull down menue.

Create Branch
_____________

Now we create a branch to implement our feature. In order to do so move your 
cursor to the buttom right corner and click on your current branch name, 
which should be main/master, next to the patlock.

.. image:: ../images/create_new_branch.png

Within the context menue click on "New Branch" and enter a branch name that
relates to your feature idea.

Add Commits
___________

Now you need to add, change or delete some content in the repository to achieve
your goal. For instance you want to add a new file "Tasks.md". Then you make a
right click onto the folder that should contain your new file.


.. image:: ../images/new_file.png

In the context menue select "new" and "File" and enter the filename in the 
consecutive prompt. Then PyCharm wants to know if Git should look after your
new file.

Normally that is a good idea and you shall choose "Add".

Push Branch
___________

Now you want to push the branch with your changes to the upstream server. This
way you create an identical copy of your local branch on the server. To do so

.. image:: ../images/git_push.png

go to the upper left corner where you can find the menue bar and click on `Git`
and choose `push` in the pull down menue.

Merge Request
_____________

Now that you pushed your local branch to the upstream server, you want to create
a merge request on the server. Therefore open your browser and go to 
`https://git.tu-berlin.de/your_name/your_project/`. On the left hand side you
click on `Merge Requests`. Then you get to a page that looks like this:

.. image:: ../images/merge_request.png

Here click on `Create merge request` to create a request to merge `your_branch`
(here: "basic_description") into main/master. Then you can add a description

.. image:: ../images/merge_request2.png

and assign a reviewer. Finally submit you merge request.


Discussion
__________

Now the reviewer of the merge request checks your changes and gives you
feedback. After some discussion you might want to go back to step 3 and add 
additional commits to change the current state. For the sake of practising 
some interations in the workshop, you can just approve your own merge requests
and continue.

Merge Branch
____________

When all discussions are done and you are sure that your changes improve the
main/master branch, it is time to merge your branch by

.. image:: ../images/final_merge.png

clicking on **Merge**.


Now master on the upstream server is newer than your local branch and its time
to start all over again (`Update Local`_).
